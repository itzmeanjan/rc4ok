# rc4ok
Lightweight High-Performance Cryptographically Strong Random Number Generator based on Improved RC4

## Overview

RC4OK is a light-weight, high-performance, cryptographically secure random number generator, which is based on an improved version of the RC4 stream cipher, which was proposed in https://ia.cr/2023/1486. It's suitable for use in IOT devices, which might lack presence of an operating system managed pseudo random number generator.

RC4OK pseudo-random number generator can be initialized with a non-empty seed string and it should produce arbitrary long pseudo-random bytes. *True* random events such as external peripheral interrupts can be used as entropy source and they can be added to the RC4OK PRNG state, *though not yet in a thread-safe manner, in this implementation*.

## Prerequisites
Rust stable toolchain; see https://rustup.rs for installation guide.

```bash
# When developing this library, I was using
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.73.0 (cc66ad468 2023-10-03)
```

I advise you to also use `cargo-criterion` for running benchmark executable. Read more about it @ https://crates.io/crates/cargo-criterion. You can just issue following command for installing it system-wide.

```bash
cargo install cargo-criterion
```

## Testing

For ensuring functional correctness and conformance of this RC4OK PRNG implementation, I generate Known Answer Tests using the official implementation by the RC4OK authors, living @ https://github.com/emercoin/rc4ok.

> **Note**
Those (reproducible) steps for generating KAT files are described in the gist https://gist.github.com/itzmeanjan/5d1379b4d324e888a2683d2820b57e23.

Issue following command to run all test cases.

```bash
cargo test --lib
```

## Benchmarking

Issue following command for benchmarking RC4OK PRNG, with variable length input and output.

> **Warning**
When benchmarking make sure you've disabled CPU frequency scaling, otherwise numbers you see can be pretty misleading. I found https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/b40db869/docs/reducing_variance.md helpful.

```bash
# In case you didn't install `cargo-criterion`, you've to run benchmark with
# RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=3 -C target-cpu=native" cargo bench rc4ok

RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=3 -C target-cpu=native" cargo criterion rc4ok
```

## Usage

Using RC4OK PRNG is fairly easy.

1) Add `rc4ok` to the *[dependencies]* section of the Cargo.toml file of your project.

```toml
[dependencies]
rc4ok = { git = "https://github.com/itzmeanjan/rc4ok" }
# or
rc4ok = "0.1.0"
```

2) Initialize RC4OK pseudo-random number generator with a non-empty key i.e. seed.

```rust
use rc4ok;

fn main() {
    const SEED_LEN: usize = 16;
    const OUT_LEN: usize = 32;

    let seed = vec![0xffu8; SEED_LEN];
    let mut out = vec![0u8; OUT_LEN];

    // Seed PRNG
    let mut rc4ok_prng = rc4ok::RC4ok::init(&seed);
    // ...
}
```

3) Request arbitrary many pseudo-random bytes from PRNG object.

```rust
// Generate pseudo-random bytes
rc4ok_prng.generate(&mut out);
```

4) You can add some entropy into the RC4OK PRNG state from time to time.

> **Warning**
RC4OK state is not *yet* thread-safe so you can't spawn a thread to harvest entropy and add that to the state of RC4OK PRNG from time to time.

```rust
let mut entropy = 0u16;          // harvest 16 -bit entropy
rc4ok_prng.add_entropy(entropy); // Add entropy
```

5) Finally you can reset the state of an existing RC4OK PRNG and reinit it with a new non-empty seed.

```rust
let another_seed = vec![0x0fu8; SEED_LEN + 1]; // Populate another seed
rc4ok_prng.reset(&another_seed);               // Re-seed PRNG
```

I'm maintaining a program (see [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs)) which can be invoked as a binary and requested for producing arbitrary many psuedo-random bytes given a non-empty seed string.

> **Note**
`rc4ok` binary executable writes requested-many or arbitrary-many pseudo-random bytes directly onto **STDOUT** device, hence you may want to pipe ( read more @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix) ) the output to a file or another program.

```bash
cargo run --release -- -h                             # For showing help text
cargo run --release -- -b 256 "this is a seed phrase" # For requesting n (=256) pseudo-random bytes, given a seed string
cargo run --release -- -s "this is a seed phrase"     # For requesting arbitrary pseudo-random bytes, given a seed string

# --- --- --- --- ---

# Encode output of rc4ok binary executable as hex string onto STDOUT.
# You may find https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6292645/convert-binary-data-to-hexadecimal-in-a-shell-script helpful.
cargo run --release -- -b 4 "this is a seed phrase" | od -A n -v -t x1 | tr -d ' \n' && echo -e # Outputs 4 pseudo random bytes
cargo run --release -- -s "this is a seed phrase" | od -A n -v -t x1 | tr -d ' \n' && echo -e   # Outputs a stream of pseudo random bytes

# Compute SHA256 digest over output of rc4ok binary executable.
cargo run --release -- -b 256 "this is a seed phrase" | sha256sum               # = 60ca173a786ab694243e274ee67c758cb562310b743a2708bca3b6fb510e2e54
cargo run --release -- -b 257 "this is a seed phrase" | sha256sum               # = 9051dc85e79360c7afda55551c9811fb52bb2fd8cbcabf791d11fd1a43666c8f
